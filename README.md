# chess

I'm creating a basic chess implementation as a pet project.

I have plans to expand this chess game once functional. I'd
like to add in AI and network components. I see a lot of
expansion potential for this project and will learn a lot
from doing it.

# future plans

* Simple AI Implementation, then more complex
* Networking for players between computers
* Exapansion into a larger self-hosted game server
